# TEAMKD-WEBSITE

This project is a blog for relating my adventure with my wife. It's a custom `WordPress` template I made during my free time. I try to make it complete and simple so it can be reuse easily.

## Plan of the presentation

I explain with all the details how I build the project and my way of working.

## Organization

## Developing

For running the project, install LAMP and run all the services :

```
sudo ./manager-linux-x64.run
```

Active the compass for watching the change and automatically create the css

```
compass watch
```
